Git 

git have different files 
.git shows the repo folder stared

after starting we make a repo

modified  | changes  | commited
								
git --version

branch 

1) creating new repo and staging

	cd\ dir

	mkdir folder_name name if folder
	
	cd folder_name
	
	git init

	git status 		# show which file in staging area and which file have been changed

	git add . 		# adds all the files we can also give git add finle path with name

	git rm --cached index.html 	#cached  file name will remove file from staging area
	


2) git commit to commit a file

	git commit -m "descriptive message " # will commit to the master branch
	
	git log 		# details of the commitedfiles
	git log --oneline 	# to see log in one line

    a) Checkout commit: state of commit inearlier code
	
	git checkout id # id is from git log --oneline	
	
	git checkout master 	# to go back to master branch
	    
    b) revert commit : rvert changes it and the changes never commited. undo 1 ispecific commit. On the staging area a new log of rever folder comes
	
	git revert id 		#after this :wq to go back to master
 
    c) reset commit : it reset to the point and 

	git reset id 

	git reset id --hard 	#won't let commit more



3) Branches
It is a isolated enviroment to cehck out the new features
We work with branch and then merge 
we can also delete the branch

	git branch branch_name 	# Create the branch

	git branch -a 		# Show all the branches and highlight current branch

	git checkout branch name 	# Switch to the branch name

	git branch -D branch name 	# -d for delte befor -d for delete after merging

	git checktout -b branch name 	# creating a branch and going in there

	

4) merging:

	git merge branch name 	# using master branch so checkout master first

Conflict occur when 2 people edit same file and merge

5) push

	git push repo link 	# Pushes code

to get rid of typping same link we can do
	
	git remote add origin repo link 

	git push origin 	# Origin can be any alis  add pink and push pink


	git clone repo link 	# To clone whole repo
when we clone the code can be pushed using push origin as by default for link



6) pull
used to pull all the updates from the repo if any changes
	
	git pull origin master 	# Do form master branch
