    "### Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing is a method for sorting and indexing data. we do this by creating keys created using formulas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity best - O(1)/worst - Q(N) {Based on collisions}\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash Function - used to map arbitary size of data to fixed size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key: Input data by a user\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash value: value returned by hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash Table: It is a DS which implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map key to values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collision: When two different keys to a hash function produce same values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties of good hash function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It dustributes hash values uniformely across the hash tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has to use all input data\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Collision Resolution techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Direct Chaining: Implements Buckets as a Linked list colliding elements are stored in this lists. Hash table full problem never arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Open Addressing: Colliding elements are stored in a open bucketa. During storage and lookup these are found so called probing.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a) Linear probing: It places new key into closest following empty cell.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b) Quadratic probing: Addign arbitrary quadratic polynomial to the index until an empty cell is found. eg 1^2, 2^2, 3^2.\n",
    "        So if  if hash function gives 10 so 10 + 1^2 if not empty so 10 + 2^2  etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    c) Double Hashing: Interval between probes is computed by another hash function.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   \n",
    "#### Hash table full\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct Chaining: \n",
    "Hash table full problem table never arises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open addressing:\n",
    "create 2X size of current table and recall hashing for current keys\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros and Cons of collision resolution techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct Chaining:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Hash table never gets full.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons: Huge linked list causes performance leaks(Time complexity for search becomes O(n)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Addressing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros: Easy implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons: When Hash Table is full, creating a new hash table affects performance(Time complexity search operation become O(N))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If input size is known we always use \"Open Addressing\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "##### If we performe deleteion operation frequently we use \"Direct chaining\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Usecase: Password Verification, File system(File path is mapped to physical location on disk)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros and Cons of hashing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) On an average Insertion/ Deletion/ Search operations take O(1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) If Hash finction is not good enough Insertion/ Deletion/ Search operations take O(n) time.\n"
