1) Docker build checked
2) Github Workflow (main.yaml)
3) Iam user in aws (GIve permission for AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess and AmazonEC2FullAccess)
4) ECR repository 
link: 818652424131.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/employee-churn



5) EC2 (T2 medium as need 1.5 gb) and connect
Down .csv containg AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID amd AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY while creating EC2.

sudo sh get-docker.sh

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

newgrp docker


6) Configure EC2 as self-hosted runner:  (When we commit code  the runner should automatically run code)

runner name - self-hosted

here after adding new runner we get commands.
copy paste them to the amazonawscli

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=  EC2

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=EC2
